Instructions: This calculator is entirely terminal based. Compile Calculator.java and run it.

Commands take the form of: [help] [radians/degrees] [store "capital_letter" "value/variable/constant"] ["expression"] [graph "function(x)"]

Parts in brackets are optional. Each part may be excluded; however, they must remain in the given order. Parts in quotes are placeholders; replace them with what they describe. Parts not in quotes must be typed exactly. Parts with slashes require you to choose one of the components.

To exit, type exit.

Use PREV as the previous answer variable.

Wrap negatives in parentheses.

Supported constants: pi, e, phi

Supported operators/functions:
 - +, -, *, /, ^, %, !
 - root(index,radicand)
 - abs(value), floor(value), ceil(value)
 - gcf(value,value), lcm(value,value)
 - ln(argument), log(base,argument)
 - choose(n,r), permute(n,r)
 - sin(value), cos(value), tan(value)
 - asin(value), acos(value), atan(value)
 - sinh(value), cosh(value), tanh(value)

Warning: Values may be slightly off due to floating point arithmetic rounding errors.

Warning: We sacrificed speed for more accurate graphs when graphing relations (graphs where y is manipulated and not just x). Each relation can take up to a minute to graph. Graphing relations is very buggy and will come out jagged and sometimes not continuous.

Warning: Graph has a range from -10 to +10 for both x and y values. If there are no values in that range, nothing will be graphed.
